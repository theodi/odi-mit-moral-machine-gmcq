# odi-mit-moral-machine-gmcq

**odi-mit-moral-machine-gmcq** is a *question component* based on the **Graphical Multiple Choice Question (GMCQ)** which is bundled with the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework). 

The Moral Machine Component is a question component built for the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework). This component extends the [MCQ component](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-mcq) and includes some of the functionalities found in the [GMCQ component](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-gmcq).

This component is based on MIT's [Moral Machine](https://www.moralmachine.net/) game. This game looks at moral choices that driverless cars will be forced make. In this game, you will have to decide what the driverless will do.

The game presents the user with a set of scenerios. In both cases there will be fatalities. The user must decide who the victims are.

To play the game, the user must click either one of the two images and then submit their decision by clicking the submit button.

## Settings overview

Each component should come with an example.json which contains an example of the data structure needed for this component to work. This enables developers to copy this over without the need for an editor.

Developers should give some description for data expected for their component and what the setting does. The example.json file for a basic component would contain at least the following:
